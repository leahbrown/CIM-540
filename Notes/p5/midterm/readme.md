Puppy race!
  When you arrive at the site, you will first name the 2 dogs on the screen.
  After you have came up with the perfect names, you then click start.
  Once you click start, you will watch the dogs race and see who wins!
  You can use the reset button to move the dogs back to the starting line or
  they will automatically go back after a few seconds.
  Have Fun!
